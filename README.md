Sound of Text
---

[Sound of Text](https://soundoftext.com) is a website built to help language
learners convert text into audio using Google's TTS Engine.

This repository contains the Node/Express API server for soundoftext.com. You
can find the web app repo [here](https://github.com/ncpierson/soundoftext-web).

You can clone this repository locally or pull the **docker image**:

```
docker pull ncpierson/soundoftext-api
```

This image requires environment variables, explained in the
[development](#manually) section below.

# Development

## Prerequisites

You will need to fill in `config/development.env`.

### Reveal Secrets

One way of getting these variables is if you are part of git secret in this
project. If so, then you can reveal the secrets as long as you have access to
your private gpg key:

```
git secret reveal
```

### Manually

You can fill in the `config/example.env` file manually:

```
cp config/example.env config/development.env
vim config/development.env # make changes!
```

Explanation:

- `DB__HOST`: hostname where mongodb is running
- `STORAGE__ACCESS_KEY_ID`: access key id for AWS or Digital Ocean Spaces
- `STORAGE__SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: secret value for the access key id
- `STRIPE__KEY`: secret stripe api key

## Run locally

The development server runs completely in docker, so no need to install
dependencies locally.

Start development server:

```
yarn start
```

You can now interact with the server at http://localhost:5757

Stop development server:

```
yarn stop
```

# Deployment

## Manual Deployment

You might want to deploy manually if you want to skip tests or do a major/minor
version bump.

As a prerequisite, you will need to have the secret files revealed, or to have
filled them in manually.

To do a version bump and deployment:

```
yarn version --patch # other options: --minor, --major
yarn deploy
```

# Documentation

## Language Codes

repository.
